# DynamicsCRM-MultiWorkflow
Simple solution for triggering workflow logic on multiple related entities.

The goal of this project is to keep things as simple and straight-forward as possible. Both from a developer and end-user point-of-view. If you seek a more robust solution, there are alternatives. For example TCSTools (http://www.itaintboring.com/category/tcs-tools/) by Alex Shlega.
